# Supyfer #
A Python bruteforcing tool developed for a CTF, based in the Python 3 version
by Matej Ramuta (https://gist.github.com/ramuta/e32865d911e087844fc8c526a72fea49?permalink_comment_id=3939062)

Supyfer simply trys all passwords in a <WORDLIST> file for logging in as sudo
for the current user. Currently works in Python 2.
